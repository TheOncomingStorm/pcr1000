I have updated the code so that I'm certain it will power-on and operate without fiddling. 

My current goal is to expand some of the capabilities of the software to include: 

more band buttons 

hotkeys for changing volume, tuning, squelch, etc. 

import stations/frequencies from RadioReference.com, RepeaterBook.com, etc.

automatic decoder selection according to frequency/band
